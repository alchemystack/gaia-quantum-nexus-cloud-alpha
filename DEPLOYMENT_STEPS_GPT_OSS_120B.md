# üåå OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B Modal Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Configuration

Your Modal deployment script has been updated to handle the official **OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B** model with:
- **117B parameters** (5.1B active) with Apache 2.0 license
- **MXFP4 quantization** optimized for 80GB GPU
- **Split GGUF files** for efficient loading
- **Enhanced resources**: 1x A100 80GB VRAM, 128GB RAM, 16 CPU cores
- **Harmony response format** for OpenAI compatibility

## üìã Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### Step 1: Upload the Model Files to Modal

Your Modal notebook is running at:
https://modal.com/notebooks/alchemystack/_/nb-j0cr4flsN8Eldy7y3ZFCBv

**Run Cell 1** in the Modal notebook to upload your local model files:
```python
# This will upload both GGUF parts from your LM Studio cache:
# - gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4-00001-of-00002.gguf
# - gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4-00002-of-00002.gguf
upload_model_from_local()
```

Expected output:
```
üöÄ CELL 1: OPENAI GPT-OSS 120B MODEL PREPARATION
Model: OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B
Format: MXFP4 quantized GGUF (split into 2 parts)
üì§ Uploading OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B from local storage...
‚úÖ Both model parts uploaded successfully!
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Server

**Run Cell 2** to start the OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B server:
```python
# This starts the llama.cpp server with the uploaded model
QuantumGPT120B()
```

Expected output:
```
üöÄ CELL 2: OPENAI GPT-OSS 120B SERVER INITIALIZATION
Model: OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B (Apache 2.0)
Configuration:
  ‚Ä¢ GPU: 1x A100 80GB VRAM (MXFP4 optimized)
  ‚Ä¢ RAM: 128GB system memory
  ‚Ä¢ CPU: 16 cores
‚úÖ OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B server is running!
   Model: 117B parameters (5.1B active)
   Format: MXFP4 quantized for 80GB GPU
```

### Step 3: Get the Deployment Endpoints

**Run Cell 3** to get your deployment URLs:
```python
# This will display your endpoint URLs
main()
```

You'll receive endpoints like:
- **Generate**: `https://alchemystack--gaia-quantum-120b-quantumgpt120b-generate.modal.run`
- **Health**: `https://alchemystack--gaia-quantum-120b-quantumgpt120b-health.modal.run`

### Step 4: Add Endpoints to Replit Secrets

Once you have the endpoints, add them to Replit Secrets:

1. Click the **Secrets** tab in Replit
2. Add these secrets:
   - `MODAL_ENDPOINT`: Your generate endpoint URL
   - `MODAL_API_KEY`: `ak-4jAZeEPxVf7YMT0MYey2dw`

### Step 5: Test the Connection

Run the connection test script:
```bash
python CONNECT_MODAL_AUTO.py
```

Expected output:
```
üåå GAIA QUANTUM NEXUS - OPENAI GPT-OSS 120B CONNECTOR
Model: OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B (117B params, 5.1B active)
‚úÖ Modal endpoint is working!
```

### Step 6: Verify in the Web Interface

Open your Replit app and check:
1. The quantum interface should show "OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B" as the model
2. Model status should be "Connected"
3. Try generating text with quantum enhancement

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Cell 1 fails to upload:
- Check that your local files exist at: `D:.cashe\lm-studio\models\lmstudio-community\gpt-oss-120b-GGUF\`
- The script will fall back to downloading from HuggingFace if local files aren't found

### If Cell 2 takes too long:
- Model loading typically takes 1-2 minutes for 117B parameters
- The server will show verbose output about layer loading progress

### If endpoints don't work:
- Check the Modal dashboard for deployment status
- Ensure the notebook cells ran in order (1, 2, 3)
- Verify the model volume persisted between runs

## üí∞ Cost Information

With the enhanced configuration:
- **Monthly cost**: ~$95-120 for 24/7 availability
- **Per-hour cost**: ~$0.13-0.16 when active
- **Keep warm**: Model stays loaded for instant response

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

Your OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B model is configured and ready. Follow the steps above in your Modal notebook to complete the deployment. The model will provide:
- Native 117B parameter inference
- MXFP4 optimized performance
- Harmony response format
- Full quantum enhancement capabilities

**Note**: The system uses ONLY true quantum randomness via QRNG with NO fallback to pseudorandomness. Generation will halt if QRNG is unavailable, maintaining strict quantum-only policy.
